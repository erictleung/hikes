# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field in computer science which involves "teaching" a
computer to perform certain tasks.

There are three broad categories of machine learning: supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Supervised learning is where you first present the computer with data and
labels to it. Then after the computer has learned on the data, the goal is now
for the computer to generalize what it has learned to label new, unseen data. A
classic example of supervised learning is hand recognition of numbers.

Unsupervised learning is similar to supervised learning except your data has no
labels. What is the point of unsupervised learning, you ask? This type of
machine learning is about learning characteristics of your data. One example of
this is grouping pictures together that look similar.

Lastly, we have reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is about giving
the computer a goal to reach and letting it explore ways of reaching this goal.

Reinforcement occurs as the computer learns and essentially asks if it is on
the right path to the goal. If the rules you've put into place say it is doing
well, then that will reinforce what it is doing and it will continue trying. An
example of this type of learning is teaching a computer to play Super Mario
Bros.
